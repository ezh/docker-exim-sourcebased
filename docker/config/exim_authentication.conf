# The following authenticators support plaintext username/password
# authentication using the standard PLAIN mechanism and the traditional
# but non-standard LOGIN mechanism, with Exim acting as the server.
# PLAIN and LOGIN are enough to support most MUA software.
#
# These authenticators are not complete: you need to change the
# server_condition settings to specify how passwords are verified.
# They are set up to offer authentication to the client only if the
# connection is encrypted with TLS, so you also need to add support
# for TLS. See the global configuration options section at the start
# of this file for more about TLS.
#
# The default RCPT ACL checks for successful authentication, and will accept
# messages from authenticated users from anywhere on the Internet.

begin authenticators

# PLAIN authentication has no server prompts. The client sends its
# credentials in one lump, containing an authorization ID (which we do not
# use), an authentication ID, and a password. The latter two appear as
# $auth2 and $auth3 in the configuration and should be checked against a
# valid username and password. In a real configuration you would typically
# use $auth2 as a lookup key, and compare $auth3 against the result of the
# lookup, perhaps using the crypteq{}{} condition.

#PLAIN:
#  driver                     = plaintext
#  server_set_id              = $auth2
#  server_prompts             = :
#  server_condition           = Authentication is not yet configured
#  server_advertise_condition = ${if def:tls_in_cipher }

# LOGIN authentication has traditional prompts and responses. There is no
# authorization ID in this mechanism, so unlike PLAIN the username and
# password are $auth1 and $auth2. Apart from that you can use the same
# server_condition setting for both authenticators.

#LOGIN:
#  driver                     = plaintext
#  server_set_id              = $auth1
#  server_prompts             = <| Username: | Password:
#  server_condition           = Authentication is not yet configured
#  server_advertise_condition = ${if def:tls_in_cipher }
