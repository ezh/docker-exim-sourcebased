begin routers

# This router routes to remote hosts over SMTP by explicit IP address,
# when an email address is given in "domain literal" form, for example,
# <user@[192.168.35.64]>. The RFCs require this facility. However, it is
# little-known these days, and has been exploited by evil people seeking
# to abuse SMTP relays. Consequently it is commented out in the default
# configuration. If you uncomment this router, you also need to uncomment
# allow_domain_literals above, so that Exim can recognize the syntax of
# domain literal addresses.

# domain_literal:
#   driver = ipliteral
#   domains = ! +local_domains
#   transport = remote_smtp


# This router routes addresses that are not in local domains by doing a DNS
# lookup on the domain name. The exclamation mark that appears in "domains = !
# +local_domains" is a negating operator, that is, it can be read as "not". The
# recipient's domain must not be one of those defined by "domainlist
# local_domains" above for this router to be used.
#
# If the router is used, any domain that resolves to 0.0.0.0 or to a loopback
# interface address (127.0.0.0/8) is treated as if it had no DNS entry. Note
# that 0.0.0.0 is the same as 0.0.0.0/32, which is commonly treated as the
# local host inside the network stack. It is not 0.0.0.0/0, the default route.
# If the DNS lookup fails, no further routers are tried because of the no_more
# setting, and consequently the address is unrouteable.

dnslookup:
  driver = dnslookup
  domains = ! +local_domains
  transport = remote_smtp
  ignore_target_hosts = 0.0.0.0 : 127.0.0.0/8
# if ipv6-enabled then instead use:
# ignore_target_hosts = <; 0.0.0.0 ; 127.0.0.0/8 ; ::1
  no_more


# This alternative router can be used when you want to send all mail to a
# server which handles DNS lookups for you; an ISP will typically run such
# a server for their customers.  If you uncomment "smarthost" then you
# should comment out "dnslookup" above.  Setting a real hostname in route_data
# wouldn't hurt either.

# smarthost:
#   driver = manualroute
#   domains = ! +local_domains
#   transport = remote_smtp
#   route_data = MAIL.HOSTNAME.FOR.CENTRAL.SERVER.EXAMPLE
#   ignore_target_hosts = <; 0.0.0.0 ; 127.0.0.0/8 ; ::1
#   no_more


# The remaining routers handle addresses in the local domain(s), that is those
# domains that are defined by "domainlist local_domains" above.


# This router handles aliasing using a linearly searched alias file with the
# name /etc/aliases. When this configuration is installed automatically,
# the name gets inserted into this file from whatever is set in Exim's
# build-time configuration. The default path is the traditional /etc/aliases.
# If you install this configuration by hand, you need to specify the correct
# path in the "data" setting below.
#
##### NB  You must ensure that the alias file exists. It used to be the case
##### NB  that every Unix had that file, because it was the Sendmail default.
##### NB  These days, there are systems that don't have it. Your aliases
##### NB  file should at least contain an alias for "postmaster".
#
# If any of your aliases expand to pipes or files, you will need to set
# up a user and a group for these deliveries to run under. You can do
# this by uncommenting the "user" option below (changing the user name
# as appropriate) and adding a "group" option if necessary. Alternatively, you
# can specify "user" on the transports that are used. Note that the transports
# listed below are the same as are used for .forward files; you might want
# to set up different ones for pipe and file deliveries from aliases.

system_aliases:
  driver = redirect
  allow_fail
  allow_defer
  data = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/aliases}}
# user = exim
  file_transport = address_file
  pipe_transport = address_pipe


# This router handles forwarding using traditional .forward files in users'
# home directories. If you want it also to allow mail filtering when a forward
# file starts with the string "# Exim filter" or "# Sieve filter", uncomment
# the "allow_filter" option.

# The no_verify setting means that this router is skipped when Exim is
# verifying addresses. Similarly, no_expn means that this router is skipped if
# Exim is processing an EXPN command.

# If you want this router to treat local parts with suffixes introduced by "-"
# or "+" characters as if the suffixes did not exist, uncomment the two local_
# part_suffix options. Then, for example, xxxx-foo@your.domain will be treated
# in the same way as xxxx@your.domain by this router. Because this router is
# not used for verification, if you choose to uncomment those options, then you
# will *need* to make the same change to the localuser router.  (There are
# other approaches, if this is undesirable, but they add complexity).

# The check_ancestor option means that if the forward file generates an
# address that is an ancestor of the current one, the current one gets
# passed on instead. This covers the case where A is aliased to B and B
# has a .forward file pointing to A.

# The three transports specified at the end are those that are used when
# forwarding generates a direct delivery to a file, or to a pipe, or sets
# up an auto-reply, respectively.

userforward:
  driver = redirect
  check_local_user
# local_part_suffix = +* : -*
# local_part_suffix_optional
  file = $home/.forward
# allow_filter
  no_verify
  no_expn

  file_transport = address_file
  pipe_transport = address_pipe

# This router matches local user mailboxes. If the router fails, the error
# message is "Unknown user".

# If you want this router to treat local parts with suffixes introduced by "-"
# or "+" characters as if the suffixes did not exist, uncomment the two local_
# part_suffix options. Then, for example, xxxx-foo@your.domain will be treated
# in the same way as xxxx@your.domain by this router.

localuser:
  driver = accept
